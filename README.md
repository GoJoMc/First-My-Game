# 🎮 My First Project Game
This is my very first game project.  
Yeah… I barely know what I'm doing, a lot of things are still scuffed 😭🔥  
But that's fine — I'm learning, messing around, and trying to get better step by step.

## 🗒️ Why Does This Repo Exist?
Simple: I want to document my journey.

Whenever I:
- Break the game → upload  
- Fix something → upload  
- Accidentally create a new bug while fixing the old bug → still upload 😭  

I want this repo to show my progress from “totally confused” to “actually decent”.

## 🌱 My Mindset
This repo is proof that:
- I'm trying to grow,
- I'm not scared of failing,
- And I'm committed to improving my game with every update.

Long road ahead, but hey… I’m enjoying the grind 😎🔥
