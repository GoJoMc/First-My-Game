#🎮My First Project Game
My First Project Is Making A Game,, There are still many shortcomings, because I don't know how to make it.
But it's okay, I'll keep learning and developing the game as best I can.

##🗒️Why Does This Repo Exist?
So I Can Document The Results Of The Games I Make
What if there are bugs in the game? I'll keep uploading and fix them in the next update.

This Repo Is Proof That I Want To Grow From Before🌱
